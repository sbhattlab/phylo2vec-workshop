## Running the Exercises

The quickest way to get started without manual installation is to use
[GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) - "a development environment that's hosted in the cloud". This allows you to run the workshop exercises directly in your browser without needing to set up a local environment.
In order to access the Codespace, you need to register an account with [GitHub](https://github.com).

:::{important}
When clicking the button below, if you have any current codespace,
we recommend deleting it to ensure you have the latest
changes from the workshop repository.

Additionally, once codespace is rendered,
please wait until the `README.md` file is loaded
to ensure that setup is complete.
